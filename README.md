This application *can* be run standalone, but is intended to be used as a Docker image from within Kubernetes.

##Local

1) Ensure you have minikube and kubectl installed.
2) Start minikube

3) You will need to expose a port from the host where kafka is running, so that
this application, running within a minikube pod, will be able to access it.
Its not too difficult:
  - First, establish the IP address that virtualbox has assigned to 
your minikube VM (its likely to be 192.168.99.1):
    ```
    ifconfig | grep vboxnet0 -A 2 | grep inet
    ```
  - Now, check the IP ("Cluster-IP) you've been assigned for your service:
      ```
      kubectl get services
      ```
  - You can access your host service (kafka!) using that IP and the port (9092).
  - Create the Environment variables the app needs within Kubernetes by running the following, substituting in your values for the server and port:
      ```
        kubectl create configmap kafka-broker-config --from-literal=KAFKA_BROKER_SERVER=10.103.3.240 --from-literal=KAFKA_BROKER_PORT=9092
      ```  
3) Build the docker image using miniKube's docker:
    ```
    eval $(minikube docker-env)
    sbt docker:publishLocal
    ```
4) Create and deploy a k8s pod with the application running within:
    ```
    kubectl apply -f knitware-converter.yaml
    ```
5) Check the pod status:
    ```
    kubectl get pod sns-knitware-converter
    kubectl describe pod sns-knitware-converter
    ```

You could now try running the E2E tests!


To stop all pods and remove a namespace:
kubectl delete ns kafka
